                        <p>Welcome to our site! My name is Dhruti Desai and I am the creator of Inspire Me! I created this website the night before my first ever concert. I spent a lot of time finding the perfect themes and expressions from others to showcase on this site.</p>
                        <p>First and foremost, we are a collection of curated posts by people like yourself. We go through many submissions and review them and see what is perfect for our site! Currently we are not taking submissions because we are expanding our site with the submissions we have already recieved, but soon we will be so keep a lookout! We would love to see your expressions.</p>
                        <p>Every post has a bit a of love and insight from the poster of what the pieces mean to them. They tell us where they got it from, what they like about it, and their thoughts. It brings people all across the world together. We love seeing submissions and what people's stories are, big and small.</p>
                        <p>The site has an option for creating your own faux profile (to keep anonymity), you can choose a cute profile picture. We also have a bio section and interests section for you to fill with all your passions! Last but not least, we have three separate pages by clothing, jewelry, and clothes, for you to look at posts with captions and the ability to like the image. Our likes are mainly to give feedback to the user and us to see what you like, you cannot see other's likes. Happy inspiring!</p>
