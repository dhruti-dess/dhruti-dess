                <p>Welcome to Seaside Brunch, a restaurant right here on the beach! Our restaurant was built in 2019, since then we have become one of the East Coastâ€™s top brunch spots with the best views. Our restaurant has the privilege of closing after sunset, so our evening guests can see as the sun melts into the ocean while enjoying their meal and then they can enjoy the beach during the night as the patio lights up. Sunset time is our busiest time of the day, we book out months in advance so make sure to call and reserve a table today!</p>
