                                <p>Our wood-fired bruschetta is made with TLC, chosen for our menu by our friend Miley. When she was in Rome she had the opportunity to attend a cooking class and learn to make authentic Bruschetta. She said it was the best food she has ever tasted in her life and brought back the recipe for us. Our bruschetta is served with fresh grape tomatoes, balsamic reduction, and EVOO.</p>

He found this recipe visiting a sports bar many years ago and drunkenly fell in love with these nachos. He took us back there so we could get a taste of it for ourselves and see what he saw in this beautiful platter. We made an even better iteration of it, our nachos are made with ground beef, hatch queso, pickled onions, and pico de gallo, and our house guacamole, sour cream, and some more delicious pico de gallo is served on the side.</p>
